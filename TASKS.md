Plans:

Pricing model = flat base + included allowance + metered overage (hybrid SaaS, like
Supabase/Vercel). Not pure pay-as-you-go — that creates bill anxiety and unpredictable
revenue. Two paid tiers at launch; add a middle "Team" tier later if the Free→Pro jump
proves too big.

Billable units (we already meter all of this — see the schema):

- "Message" = one assistant turn on a CHANNEL bot (count channel_message where
  role = assistant). This is our costliest path: the runner runs an LLM tool-calling
  loop per turn (channel_message.tokensIn/tokensOut capture the spend).
- MCP-CLIENT traffic (Claude Desktop/Cursor/ChatGPT) is NOT billed as messages — the
  client's own model does the inference; we only execute tools + serve RAG. Meter it
  as tool calls / RAG queries, or bundle it generously.
- Storage is split by where the cost actually lives:
  - Raw file storage (R2, ~$0.015/GB) — cheap, bundle generously.
  - Embedded/RAG content (pgvector in Postgres: 3072-dim halfvec + HNSW index, the
    real recurring cost) — this is what the $0.50/GB rate is for.
- Inference is usually on the org's OWN LLM key (organizationLlm.apiKey), so the
  per-message charge is mostly a PLATFORM fee (hosting/runner/RAG), priced low. If we
  ever supply a default Ganju model, that path passes tokens through with margin.

Free:

- One organization / one project, can't invite people
- mcp.ganju.ai/<slug>
- Limits: 7 tools, 3 prompts, 1 channel
- Storage: 30 MB raw files, ≤ ~5 MB embedded/RAG content
- 100 channel messages / month (HARD CAP). Free runs on our shared platform
  model key (we pay the inference), so the cap is trial-sized and the shared-key
  turn envelope (history + tool loops) is tightened to bound cost. Anyone who
  wants more for free can self-host (Apache-2.0).
- Cannot connect its own LLM (bring-your-own-key) — that's a paid feature, so
  Free always runs on (and is capped on) our shared key.
- Community support

Pro - $20/mo base + usage (base includes an allowance):

- No limits on prompts/tools/channels
- No limits on orgs/projects/invitations
- Can connect its own LLM (bring-your-own-key); BYO-key turns run on the org's
  own inference and aren't capped on our shared model
- Included each month: ~5 GB embedded content + ~3,000 channel messages. The
  included message allowance also bounds shared-model use: those 3,000 can run on
  our AI model or the org's own key, but once they're spent a channel with no own
  key must connect one to continue (we don't flat-rate our model in the overage
  zone). Note: the counter is the org's TOTAL messages, so heavy BYO traffic also
  draws down the shared allowance — acceptable because the failure mode is
  "blocks early," which never costs us inference. If mixed BYO+shared orgs prove
  common, split it into a dedicated shared-model counter.
- Overage: $0.50/GB embedded content · $2 per 1k channel messages (small — platform
  fee on BYO key, not token resale). Add a context-size fair-use cap so a few
  RAG-heavy power users don't sink the margin.
- MCP-client tool calls: bundled (metered separately, never as "messages")
- Add-on (NOT bundled): custom slug https://<mycompany>.mcp.ganju.ai/ at $15/mo —
  covers Cloudflare ACM ($10/mo) + margin; only some users want it
- User can create custom tools (programming — sandbox via vm/isolate, TBD)
- Support 24/7
